# sumeetb.dev

This is the repo for my personal website, sumeetb.dev. It's written using plain HTML and CSS (there's actually no Javascript at all), along with a single Python build script that converts my blog posts from Markdown to HTML and creates the blog index page.

Usage
This repo uses make and uv as build tools. Any other tools (including Python) will be automatically fetched by the commands below. Once you have those, there are only two commands:

make build - Builds the site and outputs it into the dist/ folder.
make serve - Uses Python's http.server to serve the website at http://localhost:8080
